commands for gdb
gcc -g error.c // this is the c file provided 
gdb a.out // now we can get the gdb prompt and work with it
list // to able to see line number 
break 10 // this is the line "ptr=getInfo()"
run // run until breakpoint 
print ptr // we can see the pointer is initialized to 0 
step // step into the getInfo function 
next next // go to the scanf line
// enter the string
print buffer // we can now see the input string in buffer variable 
next //go to the printf line 
print ptr // we can see the pointer does not change although buffer is changed 


reason for the error 
getInfo() is returning a local variable that is destroyed by the time it is used by main
